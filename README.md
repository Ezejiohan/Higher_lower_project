Higher Lower Game (Followers Comparison)
📌 Overview

This is a Python console game inspired by the Higher Lower concept.
Players are shown two public figures or brands and must guess which one has more followers. The game continues until the player makes an incorrect guess.

🎮 How the Game Works

The player compares Account A and Account B.

The player guesses who has more followers by typing A or B.

If the guess is correct, the score increases and the game continues.

If the guess is wrong, the game ends and the final score is displayed.
